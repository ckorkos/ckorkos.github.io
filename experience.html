Their services include classes that teach healthier lifestyles as well as promotion of fitness centers and useful diets to reduce sugar consumption.</p>
      <p class="tab">At this position, I worked alongside a team of interns specializing in business development, social media, graphic design, and marketing to help create a brand for the non-profit. Specifically, our main task as a group was to advertise SGP's presence at a health awareness-focused 5K run. While I entered with experience in design and programming, I was fortunate to spend more time working with these in a professional environment. I also learned skills in social media writing, event planning and advertising, and general business marketing. This was a side of the business world I was previously unfamiliar with, and time spent in this environment made me a more business-minded worker.</p>
