      <p class="tab"><a href="http://www.skinnygeneproject.org/" target="_blank">Skinny Gene Project</a> is a non-profit which works towards the prevention of prediabetes in predominantly low income communities. Their services include classes that teach healthier lifestyles as well as promotion of fitness centers and useful diets to reduce sugar consumption.</p>
      <p class="tab">At this position, I worked alongside a team of interns specializing in business development, social media, graphic design, and marketing to help create a brand for the non-profit. Specifically, our main task as a group was to advertise SGP's presence at a health awareness-focused 5K run. While I entered with experience in design and programming, I was fortunate to spend more time working with these in a professional environment. I also learned skills in social media writing, event planning and advertising, and general business marketing. This was a side of the business world I was previously unfamiliar with, and time spent in this environment made me a more business-minded worker.</p>

        <li>Graphic and Logo Design</li>
        <li>User Interface Design</li>

      <p class="tab">This was a project I completed with two other UCSD students, as a way to give back to the Cognitive Science and Computer Science departments. The website, <a href="http://www.sourcegrade.xyz/" target="_blank">SourceGrade</a>, was a redesign of an <a href="http://www.gradesource.com/" target="_blank">older grade viewing site</a>. While the site was incredibly useful, we saw important areas where it could be improved. Most notably, I contributed interface design and user research so as to improve the visual and interactive aspects of the site.</p>

      <p class="tab">This design consultation was for course credit in Computer Science 199: Independent Study. I managed a team of designers and developers to create an <a href="files/webapp/swim/MainPage/index.html" target="_blank">original design</a> for Club Assistant, LLC under the guidance and mentorship of Professor Mary Boyle. Our goal was to create a design that fixed visual and interaction issues with the <a href="https://www.swimphone.com/" target="_blank">existing site.</a></p>
      <p class="tab">My previous work had been almost exclusively focused on design and user research, with some time in web development. This project taught me the management side of design, and gave me important experience in the organizational tools used across most professional teams.</p>

      <p class="tab">Visual Design and Development: January-March 2016</p>
      <p class="tab"><b>Responsibilities</b>:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Communicating with Client</li>

      <p class="tab">This project was completed for Cognitive Science 187B: Practicum in Professional Web Design. Groups of students found clients for whom to create new websites. The sites were required to incorporate design for usability, be fully functional, and provide all necessary information regarding the client's services. My team role was Lead Designer, so my duties involved researching users creating each iteration of the website, getting the client's feedback, and working with the team programmer to create realistic designs.</p>
